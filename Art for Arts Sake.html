      <p>For multiple years we've been collecting and exploring Egyptian Art from 3000 BC till about the third century. So that the poeple at home can learn, see, and love all the art they have made. Recently we have even found remnants of an egyptian boat in our exhibit. We also currently have some of our top archaeologists searching for new undiscovered art. </p>
